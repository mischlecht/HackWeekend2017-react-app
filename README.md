## What it is.
Base app of Image Rating app

## Get Started
1. **Initial Machine Setup**. First time running the starter kit? Then complete the [Initial Machine Setup](https://github.com/coryhouse/base-react-redux-app#initial-machine-setup).
2. **Clone the project**. `git clone https://github.com/mischlecht/HackWeekend2017-react-app.git` (feel free to rename the app).
3. **cd into the directory** `cd HackWeekend2017-react-app`.
3. **Install required node modules**. `npm install`
4. **Run the example app**. `npm run dev`
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.

##Initial Machine Setup
1. **Install [Node 4.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)** - (5.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance). Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. 
3. On a Mac? You're all set. If you're on Linux or Windows, complete the steps for your OS below.
